Barney Frank as head of the Rules Committee.\\u00a0Frank\\u00a0has\\u00a0sharply criticized Sanders\\u2019 positions on breaking up big banks and Malloy has criticized Sanders on guns.\\n\\n\\u201cGovernor Malloy and Mr. Frank have both been aggressive attack surrogates for the Clinton campaign,\\u201d Sanders campaign counsel Brad Deutsch\\u00a0wrote in a letter\\u00a0to the party\\u2019s Rules and Bylaws Committee. \\u201cTheir criticisms of Sen. Sanders have gone beyond dispassionate ideological disagreement and have exposed a deeper professional, political and personal hostility toward the senator and his campaign.\\\"\\n\\nBut committee co-chairs Jim Roosevelt and Lorraine Miller responded that his challenge \\\"fails to meet the criteria\\\" for their dismissal. It did not allege any violations in the conduct of their elections to their posts by the DNC executive committee in January, they wrote.\\n\\nThe Sanders campaign\\u2019s Friday letter to Democratic National Committee rules officials marks the latest turn in Sanders\\u2019 feud with party officials. It comes a week after Sanders said he would make sure Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida isn\\u2019t reappointed to her role as head of the DNC if he becomes president and he began fundraising for her primary opponent, Tim Canova.\\n\\nMost members of the convention standing committees \\u2014 rules, platform and credentials\\u00a0\\u2014\\u00a0are awarded to candidates based on the results of those primaries and caucuses.\\u00a0But under party rules, Wasserman Schultz recommended co-chairs and a slate of 25 at-large appointments per committee for approval by the party\\u2019s executive committee.\\n\\nIn a May 6 letter to Wasserman Schultz, Sanders complained she selected only three of his more than 40 recommendations for committee appointments, and he expressed no confidence in Malloy or Frank, writing their appointments suggest\\u00a0the committees are being established \\u201cin an overtly partisan way.\\u201d\\n\\nDeutsch argued Friday that Frank and Malloy can\\u2019t be relied upon to perform convention duties fairly \\u201cwhile laboring under such deeply held bias.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThe appointment of two individuals so outspokenly critical of Sen. Sanders, and so closely affiliated with Secretary Clinton's campaign, raises concerns that two of the three Convention Standing Committees are being constituted in an overtly partisan way designed to exclude meaningful input from supporters of Sen. Sanders' candidacy,\\u201d Deutsch wrote.\\n\\nIn April, Tad Devine, Sanders\\u2019 senior adviser, said Frank is among surrogates for Hillary Clinton who used Sanders\\u2019 remarks to a New York\\u00a0Daily News editorial board on April 1 to promote a story line that questions Sanders\\u2019 capacity to be president.\\u00a0Devine pointed to Frank\\u2019s April 6 statements on MSNBC that Sanders \\u201cconfused several things\\u201d in his responses to questions about his core issue of breaking up big banks. Frank also said Sanders\\u2019 responses to the editorial board were not \\u201ccoherent.\\u201d\\n\\nFrank\\u00a0said in an April interview with USA TODAY that he would step aside from his co-chairmanship if the Democratic nomination is still uncertain in June and if a Rules Committee decision could be the deciding factor. With Clinton's decisive lead in delegates, that appears unlikely.\\n\\nA Connecticut Democratic Party spokesman told USA TODAY earlier this month that Malloy\\u00a0agrees with Sanders on many issues. On Saturday, Leigh Appleby said Malloy is committed to a platform and process reflective of the party's diverse viewpoints.\\n\\n\\\"This year's Democratic platform process is making an unprecedented effort to ensure the process is reflective of the entire party and that every Democrat has an opportunity to have their voice heard in a meaningful way,\\\" Appleby said in a statement. \\\"And at the end of the day, Democats will put forward a platform that stands in stark contrast to the hateful, divisive, and dangerous policies of Donald Trump.\\\"\",\n          \"Share This \\nHillary Clinton thought her email scandal was in the rearview mirror, but it just blew up in her face days before the election. Unfortunately for her, everything just got worse as a bombshell just exploded \\u2013 and seeing how the topic is about prison, it looks like things are about to get juicy. \\nThere\\u2019s no doubt that Hillary is as crooked as they come. Although the left would have you believe otherwise, with the presidential hopeful all but admitting her criminal acts, not too many people believe them. \\nHowever, things just got a lot worse for Hillary, but his time, it\\u2019s not only her presidential campaign that\\u2019s in jeopardy. According to The Economic Collapse , Hillary Clinton is looking at a whopping 20 years behind bars if she\\u2019s convicted of \\u201cobstruction of justice\\u201d \\u2013 a term that could very well be a life sentence for a woman of her age. A sight we may get to see soon, and one that Hillary Clinton rightfully deserves \\nAs of this point, no one is mentioning the phrase \\u201cobstruction of justice,\\u201d but that doesn\\u2019t mean the idea isn\\u2019t floating out there. In fact, when you look at the actual definition of the term in regards to the Federal statute, you start to get a better idea of just how guilty Hillary is: \\nWhoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsified, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under Title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. \\nWe already know that Hillary is guilty of trying to cover this up. Not only did she delete and \\u201cbleachbit\\u201d her server in a desperate attempt to block the FBI from finding out her dirty little secret, but then she said she didn\\u2019t have the emails they were looking for. \\nOf course, when others stumbled across the mythical 33,000 emails, things started to take a turn \\u2013 and it all just got worse. According to The Wall Street Journal , the FBI now has another 650,000 emails to sort through with about 10,000 pertinent to Hillary\\u2019s case. Things aren\\u2019t looking so good for Hillary Clinton \\nWhy did FBI Director James Comey find the need to come forward with this information so close to the election? Well, as it turns out, the answer is rather simple \\u2013 redemption. \\nAccording to a Daily Mail article written by Ed Klein, the author of a bestseller about the Clintons entitled Guilty As Sin , it seems as though Comey was suffering for letting off Hillary so easy. As explained by Klein: \\n\\u201cSome people, including department heads, stopped talking to Jim, and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall,\\u201d said the source. \\u2018They felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist. He told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom.\\u201d \\nFurther speculation pertaining to Comey\\u2019s reasoning seems to indicate that the urgency here stems from the information actually found. Knowing just how much the release would impact the election, one can only assume that Comey was only comfortable in doing so as someone had already found something really big. \\nThe fact of the matter is, people had lost faith in justice after Comey\\u2019s dismissal of Hillary\\u2019s charges. After proving that power meant exclusion from the law, it seems as though the FBI Director is trying to right that wrong today. Furthermore, as there seems to be something of substantive nature, Hillary can expect to be facing 20 years behind bars \\u2013 a sentence a great many people would feel is justified.\",\n          \"George P.
