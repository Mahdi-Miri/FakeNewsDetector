# Fake News Detector using Naïve Bayes  

## Project Description  
This project implements a **Fake News Detection** system using the Naïve Bayes classifier. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, and the text data undergoes preprocessing, feature extraction (Factor Annotation), and classification.  

## Features  
- Data collection from Kaggle  
- Text preprocessing and feature extraction (Factor Annotation)  
- Converting text into TF-IDF vectors  
- Training and evaluating a Naïve Bayes classifier for fake news detection  

## Installation and Setup  
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mahdi-Miri/FakeNewsDetector.git  
cd FakeNewsDetector  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
python main.py
